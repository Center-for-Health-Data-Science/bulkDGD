# `bulkdgd_train`

This command allows you to train the bulkdgd model.

`bulkdgd_train` takes as input:

* A CSV files containing the expression data (RNA-seq read counts) for the training and test samples. The program expects the input data frame to display samples as rows and genes as columns. The samples' names/indexes/IDs should be in the first column of the data frame. The genes' names are expected to be their Ensembl IDs. Additional columns containing sample metadata (for instance, tissue of origin) are allowed.

* A plain text file with a newline-separated list of the names/indexes/IDs of the training samples.

* A plain text file with a newline-separated list of the names/indexes/IDs of the test samples.

It is recommended to pre-process the samples with [`bulkdgd_preprocess_samples`](bulkdgd_preprocess_samples.md) before using them.

`bulkdgd_train` also needs two configuration files:

* A YAML configuration file specifying the bulkdgd model's options. Examples of this configuration file can be found in `bulkdgd/configs/model`: `model_tgmm.yaml` for the current Gaussian mixture model implementation, `model_lgmm.yaml` for the legacy one. Both describe an architecture and name no parameter files, which is what training a new model needs.

* A YAML configuration file defining the options used for the training process. An example of this configuration file can be found in `bulkdgd/configs/training`.

## Training a model that is already trained

A model built from fitted parameters - which is what a configuration file naming a `latent_pth_file` and a `decoder_pth_file` gives, and what `BulkDGD()` gives in Python - starts from the published optimum, and training it moves it away from that silently: the object still answers to the same name, and nothing in the output says that its results are no longer the published model's.

Training therefore **refuses** on such a model unless the training configuration asks for it in as many words, by setting

```yaml
continue_training: true
```

at its top level. Continuing to train a trained model is legitimate for fine-tuning it on a new cohort, which is why the option exists; absent it the answer is no, because the mistake is silent and the deliberate case is not.

To train a new model instead, build it from an architecture: use one of the configuration files above, which name no parameters.

The executable produces six to eight output files. These files are always produced:

* A CSV file containing a data frame with the representations found for the training samples.

* A CSV file containing a data frame with the representations found for the test samples.

* A CSV file containing a data frame with the means of the distributions modeling the genes for the training samples.

* A CSV file containing a data frame with the means of the distributions modeling the genes for the test samples.

* A CSV file containing a data frame with the losses computed during training.

* A CSV file containing information about the CPU and wall clock time used by each epoch during training.

If the genes' are modeled by negative binomial distributions (instead of Poisson distributions) and the r-values of the distributions are learned per gene, one additional file is produced:

* A CSV file containing a data frame with the r-values of the negative binomial distributions modeling the genes.

If the genes' are modeled by negative binomial distributions (instead of Poisson distributions) and the r-values of the distributions are learned per gene and per sample, two additional files are produced:

* A CSV file containing a data frame with the r-values of the negative binomial distributions modeling the genes for the training samples.

* A CSV file containing a data frame with the r-values of the negative binomial distributions modeling the genes for the test samples.

## Parallelization

The command can be run in parallel over different inputs in different directories by using the `-ds`, `--dirs` option. The directories may be specified either by name (if they are in the current working directory) or their absolute or relative path. 

* If `-ds dir1 path/to/dir2`, the program will be run in parallel in each directory using the input and configuration files in it. The names of the input files may be provided using the `-is`/`--input-samples`, `-it`/`--input-train`, and `-ie`/`--input-test` options, and the names of the configuration files may be provided using the `-icm`/`--input-config-file-model` and `-ict`/`--input-config-file-train` options. The output files and the log file for each run will be saved in the corresponding directory and named according to the file names provided in the `-ort`/`--output-rep-train`, `-ore`/`--output-rep-test`, `-opmt`/`--output-pred-means-train`, `-opme`/`--output-pred-means-test`, `-opv`/`--output-pred-rvalues`, `-opvt`/`--output-pred-rvalues-train`, `-opve`/`--output-pred-rvalues-test`, `-ol`/`--output-loss`, `-ot`/`--output-time`, and `-lf`/`--log-file` options.

* If `-ds file.txt`, `file.txt` the file is expected to contain a newline-separated list of either names of directories in the working directory or absolute/relative paths to directories. The same input, configuration, and output options as above apply. `file.txt` can, for instance, look like this:

    .. code-block::

       dir1
       dir2
       absolute/path/to/dir3
       ..relative/path/to/dir4
       ...
       ...

| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `-olat`, `--output-latent` | The output .pth file where the latent space's parameters will be saved after training. By default, the file will be named `latent.pth`. |

| `-ogmmf`, `--output-gmm-final` | The output .pth file where the parameters of the Gaussian mixture model fitted to the representations after training will be saved. It is written only if the model's configuration has a `gmm_final` section. It is a separate file from the one given by `-olat`, `--output-latent`, which keeps the prior the model was trained with. By default, the file will be named `gmm_final.pth`. |

If the model's output module returns r-values per gene and per sample, the `-opvt`, `--output-pred-rvalues-train` and `-opve`, `--output-pred-rvalues-test` options should be used instead. |
| `-opvt`, `--output-pred-rvalues-train` | The output CSV file containing the data frame with the r-value for each gene in each training sample. The default file name is `pred_r_values_train.csv`. This option will be used only if the model's output module returns r-values per gene and per sample. |
| `-opve`, `--output-pred-rvalues-test` | The output CSV file containing the data frame with the r-value for each gene in each test sample. The default file name is `pred_r_values_test.csv`. This option will be used only if the model's output module returns r-values per gene and per sample. |

| `-omt`, `--output-metrics-train` | The output CSV file containing the data frame with the per-epoch values of the latent space clustering metrics computed during training for the training samples. The default file name is `metrics_train.csv`. This file will be written only if at least one clustering metric is computed during training (they are specified in the `-ict`, `--input-config-file-train` configuration file).|
| `-ome`, `--output-metrics-test` | The output CSV file containing the data frame with the per-epoch values of the latent space clustering metrics computed during training for the test samples. The default file name is `metrics_test.csv`.

Every one of these tables is written through `bulkdgd.ioutil.save_table`, which picks the format from the file's suffix: the default names end in `.csv` and are written as text, and a name ending in `.parquet` is written as Parquet instead. Parquet is the format that returns a `float64` unchanged, so it is the one to ask for when the numbers are going to be compared between runs.

## Example

```
bulkdgd_train -is samples_preprocessed.csv -it samples_train.txt -ie samples_test.txt -icm model.yaml -ict training.yaml
```

This trains a new bulkdgd model on the samples listed in `samples_train.txt`/`samples_test.txt` (a subset of the samples found in `samples_preprocessed.csv`), using the model architecture described in `model.yaml` and the training options described in `training.yaml`.
