Configuration for the optimization scheme
=========================================

So far, two optimization schemes to find the representations have been implemented:

* ``one_opt``, which consists of only one round of optimization for the best representations found for the samples in latent space. The ``one_opt`` scheme is implemented in the YAML file ``bulkdgd/configs/representations/one_opt.yaml``.

* ``two_opt``, which consists of two consecutive rounds of optimizations. Indeed, multiple candidate representations per sample are found, optimized, and the best one for each sample is picked from the pool. Then, a second round of optimization (similar to the one run under the ``one_opt`` scheme) is performed on these selected representations. The ``two_opt`` scheme is implemented in the YAML file ``bulkdgd/configs/representations/two_opt.yaml``.

The options to customize these schemes can be passed as a nested dictionary or are specified in a YAML configuration file.

The function that loads the configuration file is :func:`bulkdgd.ioutil.load_config_rep`.

The options that can be specified are described below.

* ``"scheme_type"`` is the optimization scheme to use. This can be:

   * ``"lgmm"`` for the legacy Gaussian Mixture Model implementation.

The prediction REPLACES one of the ``"n_rep_per_comp"`` times the number of components candidates of each sample rather than being added to them, so every count the scheme assumes is unchanged. Absent by default, in which case every candidate comes from the mixture as before.

           The predictor maps a sample's counts to its representation and is fitted on the model's own training representations, which it recovers with an :math:`R^2` of about 0.84 - the map is very nearly linear, not because the decoder is linear but because projecting 14,740 genes down to a few dozen numbers is massively overdetermined. It is not an encoder and enters neither the generative model nor the objective; it only chooses where the search starts. Used ALONE it reaches a worse optimum than the candidate competition does, which is why it takes one slot rather than all of them.
