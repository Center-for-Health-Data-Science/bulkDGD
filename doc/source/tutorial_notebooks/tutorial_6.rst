Tutorial 6 - Differential expression and gene set enrichment with the ensemble
==============================================================================

Which genes a single bulkdgd model calls differentially expressed depends on the seed it was trained with, so which of those genes are real is not a question one model can answer. What can be answered is how many of several identically trained models agree on a gene, and that is what the ensemble is for: fifteen models sharing an architecture, a gene universe, a training set and a train/test split, and differing only in the seed they were fitted with.

This tutorial takes a set of samples through the ensemble end to end - representations, differential expression, the tiered consensus drawn from what the members call, and gene set enrichment - and closes with when the ensemble is worth its cost and when the single model is enough.

It assumes :doc:`Tutorial 1 <tutorial_1>` and :doc:`Tutorial 2 <tutorial_2>`, which do the first two of those steps with one model.

Loading the ensemble
--------------------

``BulkDGDEnsemble()``, called with no arguments, is the ensemble that ships with the package. The members differ in nothing but their seed, so describing them by hand would mean writing the same architecture fifteen times and fifteen paths that have to agree with it; given neither configuration, the class builds both from what the package ships.

.. code-block:: python

   # Import from the standard library.
   import logging as log
   import os

   # Import from third-party libraries.
   import pandas as pd

   # Import from 'bulkdgd'.
   from bulkdgd import ioutil
   from bulkdgd.ensemble import BulkDGDEnsemble

   # Set the logging options so that every message of level INFO or
   # above is emitted.
   log.basicConfig(level = "INFO")

   # Get the ensemble that ships with the package. The shared
   # architecture is read once, from the base member's configuration
   # file, and one entry is made per shipped seed.
   ensemble = BulkDGDEnsemble()

.. code-block:: text

   INFO:bulkdgd.ensemble.ensemble:The ensemble was successfully set (15 models, seeds: 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101).

Nothing has been loaded at this point. The ensemble knows which members it has, what they are seeded with, and where their fitted parameters live, and it holds no model:

.. code-block:: python

   # The members' names, which are the seeds they are trained with.
   ensemble.names

   # The seeds themselves, as integers.
   ensemble.seeds

   # How many models the ensemble is made of.
   ensemble.n_models

   # The device the members are placed on when they are built.
   ensemble.device

A member is built only when it is asked for, one at a time, by ``get_model``:

.. code-block:: python

   # Build one member, with its trained parameters loaded. It is an
   # ordinary 'bulkdgd.core.model.BulkDGD', and behaves exactly as the
   # one in Tutorial 1.
   model = ensemble.get_model(name = "seed37")

``BulkDGD()`` with no arguments is the base member, ``seed37``, on its own. It is the model the paper reports, and nothing distinguishes it from the other fourteen; running the whole ensemble is what this tutorial is about, and running only ``seed37`` is :doc:`Tutorial 1 <tutorial_1>`.

What the first run downloads
----------------------------

Each member's fitted mixture (``gmm.pth``, about 28 KiB) ships with the package. Its decoder does not: at about 1.79 GiB in ``float64`` a single one is close to the 2 GiB limit on a GitHub release asset, and fifteen of them are not something to put on PyPI. They are fetched on demand, one asset per member and per release, from

.. code-block:: text

   https://github.com/Center-for-Health-Data-Science/bulkdgd/releases/download/v{version}/dec_{seed}.pth

and land in the per-seed directory the package expects them in, ``bulkdgd/data/model/{seed}/dec.pth``, **inside the installed package**. Three consequences are worth knowing before the first run:

* The full ensemble is about **27 GiB** of one-off downloads. Later runs reuse the files.

* The install has to be writable. A read-only or system-wide install will fail on the first member it tries to fetch.

* A member is fetched the first time that member is built, so the download is spread over the run and not paid up front.

``status`` reports what is already on disk, and is a download checklist as much as a training checklist - ``trained`` is ``False`` for a member whose decoder has not been fetched yet:

.. code-block:: python

   # Report what each member already has: whether its parameters are
   # there, how many samples it has differential expression results
   # for, and whether those results are packed.
   ensemble.status()

.. code-block:: text

            seed  trained  n_samples_dea  dea_packed
   name
   seed37     37     True              0       False
   seed41     41    False              0       False
   seed43     43    False              0       False
   ...

Where the results go
--------------------

Every member has a ``"results_dir"``, and everything run with that member is written under it. There is nowhere inside an installed package that a user's output belongs, so the shipped configuration puts them under the working directory, in ``bulkdgd_ensemble_results/{seed}``. The path is resolved when the ensemble is built, so it is the working directory *at that moment* that decides where the results land.

To put them somewhere of your own, pass a configuration to the method you are calling. It may point the ensemble's members at different directories, and it may not change which members there are:

.. code-block:: python

   # Keep the members the ensemble already has, and move their
   # results. 'dict(options, results_dir = ...)' copies each member's
   # entry and replaces one key of it.
   config_ensemble = \
       {name : dict(options,
                    results_dir = os.path.join("/data/brca", name))
        for name, options in ensemble.config_ensemble.items()}

This is also how a second cohort is run through the same members without its results landing on top of the first cohort's: same ensemble, a different ``config_ensemble`` per cohort. Every method below takes it as the optional ``config_ensemble`` argument.

Preprocess the samples
----------------------

The ensemble takes the samples exactly as a single model does - a data frame with the samples as rows and the model's genes as columns - so the preprocessing is the one in :doc:`Tutorial 1 <tutorial_1>`, done once for the whole ensemble, since every member shares a gene universe:

.. code-block:: python

   # Load the samples into a data frame.
   df_samples = \
       ioutil.load_samples(csv_file = "samples.csv",
                           sep = ",",
                           keep_samples_names = True,
                           split = False)

   # Match the samples' genes against the model's: genes the model
   # does not know about are dropped, and genes it expects that are
   # missing are added back with a count of 0.
   df_preproc, genes_excluded, genes_missing = \
       ioutil.preprocess_samples(df_samples = df_samples)

Find the representations
------------------------

Differential expression needs each member's own prediction for each sample, so the representations come first. This is the step that builds the members, and therefore the step that downloads the decoders and takes the time: finding a representation is a per-sample optimization in latent space, and the ensemble runs it fifteen times.

.. code-block:: python

   # Load the default configuration for the two-round optimization
   # scheme.
   config_rep = ioutil.load_config_rep(None)

   # Find the representations with every member, one member at a time.
   results_rep = \
       ensemble.find_representations(
           # The data frame with the pre-processed samples
           df_samples = df_preproc,
           # The configuration for the search, which is the one a
           # single 'BulkDGD' takes
           config_rep = config_rep,
           # Whether to skip the members that already have their
           # representations on disk
           resume = True)

Each member writes ``representations.csv``, ``pred_means.csv`` and ``time.csv`` into its results' directory, plus ``pred_r_values.csv`` when the output module has r-values, which the shipped model's does. The predicted means are the in silico control the next step compares the observed counts against.

A member that fails is recorded and the ones after it are run anyway - fourteen good models are not worth throwing away because the fifteenth could not be read - so what came back has to be looked at:

.. code-block:: python

   # What happened to each member: 'done', 'skipped' or 'failed'.
   {name : result["status"] for name, result in results_rep.items()}

   # Why a member failed, if one did.
   results_rep["seed41"]["error"]

Every stage below returns a dictionary of the same shape, keyed by member name, with the keys ``"name"``, ``"seed"``, ``"status"``, ``"outputs"``, ``"error"`` and ``"elapsed"``.

.. note::

   ``resume = True`` skips a member that already has *all* of its outputs. It is what makes a run that died halfway cheap to restart, and it is also what silently reuses a stale result: a cohort re-run with different options into the same directories will be skipped, not recomputed. Point the results elsewhere, or pass ``resume = False``.

Differential expression across the ensemble
-------------------------------------------

``dea`` compares each sample's observed counts against each member's predicted means, and computes p-values, q-values and log2-fold changes exactly as :doc:`Tutorial 2 <tutorial_2>` does with one model. It reads ``pred_means.csv`` and ``pred_r_values.csv`` out of each member's results' directory, where the previous step left them, and **builds no model at all**, so this stage needs neither the decoders nor a GPU. It does mean the two calls have to be given the same ``config_ensemble``, since that is what says where those files are:

.. code-block:: python

   # Perform differential expression analysis with every member.
   results_dea = \
       ensemble.dea(
           # The data frame with the same pre-processed samples
           df_samples = df_preproc,
           # The configuration for the analysis
           config_dea = \
               {# Where a member's results are written. A relative
                # path is taken relative to the member's results'
                # directory.
                "dea_dir" : "dea",
                # Which statistics to compute
                "statistics" : ["p_values", "q_values",
                                "log2_fold_changes"],
                # The resolution of the p-values' calculation (set it
                # to 'None' for an exact calculation)
                "resolution" : 1e4,
                # The family-wise error rate for the q-values
                "alpha" : 0.05,
                # The method used to adjust the p-values
                "method" : "fdr_bh",
                # The device the p-values are computed on
                "device" : "cpu"},
           # Whether to skip the samples that already have results
           resume = True)

Everything in ``config_dea`` that is not one of the ensemble's own keys is passed straight on to :func:`bulkdgd.analysis.dea.get_statistics`.

One of those keys is filled in for you. The statistics are computed against a scaled predicted mean, and which scaling was used is a property of the model the ensemble is made of, something the function computing the statistics has no way to ask. ``scaling_factor`` is therefore taken from the ensemble's own model configuration - ``"median"``, for the shipped ensemble - unless you pass it yourself. Passing the wrong one leaves every predicted mean wrong by the ratio of the two, about three, while every p-value still looks like a p-value.

The results are written one file per sample per member, under ``{results_dir}/dea``, as ``dea_{sample}.parquet``. That is what makes the analysis resumable where it matters: a run that dies halfway picks up at the first sample that has no file, and not at the first member. Each file holds one row per gene, with the columns ``p_value``, ``q_value``, ``log2_fold_change``, ``is_eligible_down``, and the ``dgd_mean`` and ``dgd_r`` the statistics were computed from, so that a sample's file says what produced it. Everything that reads these results looks the sample up by name and takes whichever form is on disk, so the ``.csv`` files older runs wrote keep loading.

.. note::

   One file per sample per member is fifteen times the file count of a single-model run, which is tens of thousands of small files for a cohort of any size. ``"zip_results" : True`` in ``config_dea`` packs each member's results into one archive once they are all there and removes the loose files; the archive is written, closed and read back before anything is removed, and everything downstream reads either form.

How the members' calls are combined
-----------------------------------

``consensus`` turns fifteen sets of per-sample calls into one tiered list of genes per group of samples. Three definitions carry it, and they are worth stating precisely, because "the ensemble agrees" is the whole claim:

* A model **calls** a gene for a sample when the gene's q-value is below ``q_val`` and the absolute value of its log2-fold change is above ``log2_fold_change``. Both comparisons are strict.

* A model **considers** a gene for a group of samples when it calls the gene in at least a ``recurrence`` share of that group's samples. Recurrence is computed within a group, and never across groups.

* A gene's **tier** is how many of the ensemble's models consider it: the number of models that agree on it. The **consensus recurrence** reported for a gene of tier *K* is the *K*-th largest of its per-model recurrences, which is the level at which *K* models agree. Genes below ``min_tier`` are left out.

Three models and ten samples in one group make the arithmetic visible:

.. code-block:: text

   gene    samples called in    recurrences, largest first   tier   consensus_recurrence
   GENE_A  10/10, 8/10, 4/10              1.00, 0.80, 0.40      3                   0.40
   GENE_B   5/10, 2/10, 1/10              0.50, 0.20, 0.10      2                   0.20
   GENE_C   3/10, 1/10, 0/10              0.30, 0.10, 0.00      1                      -

At the default ``recurrence`` of ``0.20``, all three of ``GENE_A``'s models consider it, so it is tier 3, and the third-largest recurrence, ``0.40``, is the level at which three models agree on it. Two of ``GENE_B``'s three do, so it is tier 2 at ``0.20``. Only one of ``GENE_C``'s does, and at the default ``min_tier`` of ``2`` a gene one model considers is not something the ensemble agrees on, so it is dropped.

Samples that any one model has no results for are dropped for the whole ensemble, and the number dropped is reported. A gene's tier is how many models agree on it, and that is only comparable between genes if every gene was offered the same models.

.. code-block:: python

   # The samples' metadata, indexed by the samples' names. It must
   # carry the column the samples are grouped by, and the column they
   # are filtered on, if any.
   df_metadata = pd.read_csv("metadata.csv", index_col = 0)

   # The genes' symbols, mapped from the genes' Ensembl IDs. They are
   # optional, and only cosmetic: a gene with no entry keeps its
   # Ensembl ID as its symbol.
   genes_symbols = \
       pd.read_csv("genes_symbols.csv",
                   index_col = 0).iloc[:, 0].to_dict()

   # Draw the consensus.
   dfs_consensus = \
       ensemble.consensus(
           # The data frame with the samples' metadata
           df_metadata = df_metadata,
           # The configuration for the consensus
           config_consensus = \
               {# The metadata column the samples are grouped by, and
                # within which a gene's recurrence is computed
                "group_column" : "cancer_type",
                # The name the group is given in the output
                "group_name" : "cancer_type",
                # A metadata column the samples are filtered on before
                # anything else, and the value they must have in it -
                # here, keeping the primary tumours and leaving the
                # metastatic ones out
                "filter_column" : "sample_type",
                "filter_value" : "Primary Tumor",
                # Where a member's results are read from
                "dea_dir" : "dea",
                # The thresholds a gene must pass to be called for a
                # sample
                "q_val" : 0.05,
                "log2_fold_change" : 1.0,
                # The share of a group's samples a model must call a
                # gene in to consider it
                "recurrence" : 0.20,
                # The tier below which a gene is left out
                "min_tier" : 2,
                # The genes' symbols, mapped from the genes' names
                "genes_symbols" : genes_symbols,
                # How many processes to score the samples with
                "n_processes" : 8})

What comes back is a dictionary mapping each group to a data frame with one row per gene, with the genes the most models agree on first. The rows below continue the three-model example, so that ``rec_sorted`` fits on a line; a run of the shipped ensemble carries fifteen recurrences and tiers up to 15.

.. code-block:: text

     cancer_type             gene  symbol  tier  consensus_recurrence         rec_sorted
   0        BRCA  ENSG00000141510    TP53     3                   0.40  1.000|0.800|0.400
   1        BRCA  ENSG00000012048   BRCA1     2                   0.20  0.500|0.200|0.100

``rec_sorted`` is every per-model recurrence, largest first, so the whole distribution behind a tier is on the row and a tier can be recomputed at a different ``recurrence`` without reading the per-sample files again. ``symbol`` falls back to the gene's name when ``genes_symbols`` has no entry for it.

.. code-block:: python

   # Write each group's consensus.
   for group, df_consensus in dfs_consensus.items():

       df_consensus.to_csv(f"consensus_{group}.csv",
                           index = False,
                           sep = ",")

.. note::

   ``consensus`` raises if any member has no results at all. A member with no results would drop every sample, and the consensus would come back empty with nothing to say why.

Gene set enrichment
-------------------

``gsea`` scores, for each member and each sample, how enriched a set of genes of interest is among the genes that member calls for that sample. It reads the differential expression back from disk, packed or loose, so it needs no model either.

The gene sets are a dictionary mapping a name to a list of genes. They are intersected with the index of the per-sample statistics, which holds Ensembl IDs, so the sets must be Ensembl IDs too:

.. code-block:: python

   # The sets of genes of interest, as Ensembl IDs.
   genes_sets = \
       {"brca_drivers" : \
           [line.strip() for line in open("brca_drivers.txt")],
        "housekeeping" : \
           [line.strip() for line in open("housekeeping.txt")]}

   # Compute the enrichment scores with every member.
   results_gsea = \
       ensemble.gsea(
           # The sets of genes of interest
           genes_sets = genes_sets,
           # The configuration for the analysis
           config_gsea = \
               {# Where a member's differential expression is read
                # from
                "dea_dir" : "dea",
                # Where a member's enrichment scores are written
                "gsea_dir" : "gsea",
                # The thresholds a gene must pass to count as
                # significant
                "p_val" : 0.05,
                "q_val" : 0.05,
                "log2_fold_change" : 1.0},
           # Whether to skip the members that already have their
           # enrichment scores
           resume = True)

Everything in ``config_gsea`` that is not one of the ensemble's own keys is passed on to :func:`bulkdgd.analysis.dea.get_significant_genes`.

Each member writes one ``e_scores.csv`` into ``{results_dir}/gsea``, covering every sample it has results for, with the columns ``sample``, ``genes_set``, ``num_genes_in_set``, ``num_genes_significant`` and ``e_score``. A score of 1 is what a set of that size would get by chance among that many significant genes; above 1 is enrichment. Reading the fifteen files back and comparing a set's score across the members says how much of the enrichment survived the seed:

.. code-block:: python

   # Read every member's enrichment scores back, keeping track of
   # which member each row came from.
   dfs = []

   for name, result in results_gsea.items():

       # A member that failed has no outputs, so skip it - and know
       # that the spread below is over one member fewer.
       if result["status"] == "failed":
           continue

       df = pd.read_csv(result["outputs"]["e_scores"])

       df.insert(0, "member", name)

       dfs.append(df)

   df_e_scores = pd.concat(dfs, ignore_index = True)

   # The spread of each set's score across the members, per sample.
   df_e_scores.groupby(["sample", "genes_set"])["e_score"].describe()

.. note::

   The thresholds are **not** shared with the consensus, and their defaults differ: :func:`bulkdgd.analysis.dea.get_significant_genes` defaults to a ``log2_fold_change`` of ``2``, while the consensus defaults to ``1.0``. It also filters on ``p_val``, which the consensus ignores entirely, and it compares inclusively (``<=``, ``>=``) where the consensus compares strictly (``<``, ``>``), so a gene sitting exactly on a threshold is significant here and is not called there. Pass the same thresholds to both if the two answers are meant to be about the same genes.

When to use the ensemble, and when one model is enough
------------------------------------------------------

The ensemble answers one question, and it costs fifteen times a single run to answer it. Use it when that question is the one you are asking:

* **A per-gene claim about a cohort that will be taken forward** - a driver list, a signature, a set of genes handed to someone who will spend a bench week on them. One model's list is one draw from a distribution over training seeds, and a tier is how many independent draws agree. The same argument, for the seed the *representation search* starts from, has been measured: the calls several seeds agree on overlap a cancer-matched driver catalogue substantially more often than the calls only one of them makes (see :ref:`rep_multiseed`).

* **Anything going into a paper**, for the same reason: a result quoted from one seed is a result nobody else's seed has to reproduce.

* **Comparing methods**, where "the model found this and DESeq2 did not" needs to survive the model being re-fitted.

The single model is the right tool, and not a compromise, when:

* **The result is per-sample.** The consensus is a statement about a group, drawn from recurrences within it. It has nothing to say about one sample, so a per-sample p-value, an imputation, or a representation used as a feature is a single-model job. Fifteen answers per sample is fifteen answers, not a better one.

* **The cohort has few samples per group.** A recurrence is a share of a group's samples: at ``0.20``, a group of five calls a gene "recurrent" on the strength of a single sample, so with a handful of samples per group a tier is counting single samples, and a group of one has no recurrence to compute. Check the group sizes before reading anything into the tiers.

* **You are exploring**, where the answer changes several times before it matters and 27 GiB of decoders plus fifteen representation searches is a poor way to find out that the samples were preprocessed wrong.

The two are not exclusive, and the cheap half of the split is worth knowing: the representations are the expensive stage and the only one that needs a decoder, so an exploratory pass with ``BulkDGD()`` on one seed and a final pass with the full ensemble share their preprocessing and their gene set, and cost nothing to run in that order.
