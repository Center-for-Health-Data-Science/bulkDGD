        Where :math:`\\epsilon` is a small value to prevent underflow/
        overflow.

        The derivation of this formula from the non-logarithmic
        formulation of the probability mass function of the Poisson
        distribution can be found below.

        ----------
        k : :class:`torch.Tensor`
            A one-dimensional tensor containing he "number of

        m : :class:`torch.Tensor`
            A one-dimensional tensor containing the means of the

            Each value in the tensor corresponds to the mean of a
            different Poisson distribution.

        Returns
        -------
        x : :class:`torch.Tensor`
            A one-dimensional tensor containing the lhe log-probability
            mass of each Poisson distribution.

            Each value in the tensor corresponds to the log-probability
            mass of a different Poisson distribution.

        Notes
        -----
        Here, we show how we derived the formula for the logarithm of
        the probability mass of the Poisson distribution.

        We start from the non-logarithmic version of the probability
        mass for the Poisson distribution, which is:

        .. math::

           PDF_{Poisson(k,m)} = \
           \\frac{m^{k}e^{-m}}{k!}

        However, since:

        * :math:`k!` can be rewritten in terms of the
          gamma function as :math:`\\Gamma(k+1)`

        The formula becomes:

        .. math::

           PDF_{Poisson(k,m)} = \
           \\frac{m^{k}e^{-m}}{\\Gamma(k+1)}

        Then, we get the natural logarithm of both sides:
        
        .. math::

           logPDF_{Poisson(k,m)} &= \
           k * log(m) - m - log\\Gamma(k+1)
        
        Finally, we add a small value :math:`\\epsilon` to prevent
        underflow/overflow:

        .. math::

           logPDF_{Poisson(k,m)} &= \
           k * log(m + \\epsilon) - m - log\\Gamma(k+1)
        """

        # Convert the "number of successes" to a double-precision
        # floating point number.
        k = k.double()
        
        # Set a small value used to prevent underflow and overflow.
        eps = 1.e-10
        
        # Get the log-probability mass of the Poisson distributions.

        Where :math:`\\epsilon` is a small value to prevent underflow/
        overflow, and :math:`c` is equal to
        :math:`\\frac{1}{r+m+\\epsilon}`.

        The derivation of this formula from the non-logarithmic
        formulation of the probability mass function of the negative

        ----------
        k : :class:`torch.Tensor`
            A one-dimensional tensor containing he "number of

            A one-dimensional tensor containing the "number of

            Each value in the tensor corresponds to the number of
            failures in a different negative binomial.

        Returns
        -------
        x : :class:`torch.Tensor`
            A one-dimensional tensor containing the lhe log-probability
            mass of each negative binomial distributions.

            Each value in the tensor corresponds to the log-probability
            mass of a different negative binomial.

        Notes
        -----
        Here, we show how we derived the formula for the logarithm of
        the probability mass of the negative binomial distribution.

        We start from the non-logarithmic version of the probability
        mass for the negative binomial, which is:

        .. math::

           PDF_{NB(k,m,r)} = \
           \\binom{k+r-1}{k} (1-p)^{k} p^{r}

        However, since:

        * :math:`1-p` is equal to :math:`\\frac{m}{r+m}`
        * :math:`p` is equal to :math:`\\frac{r}{r+m}`
        * :math:`k+r-1` can be rewritten in terms of the
          gamma function as :math:`\\Gamma(k+r)`
        * :math:`k` can also be rewritten as
          :math:`\\Gamma(r) \\cdot k!`

        The formula becomes:

        .. math::

           PDF_{NB(k,m,r)} = \
           \\binom{\\Gamma(k+r)}{\\Gamma(r) \\cdot k!}
           \\left( \\frac{m}{r+m} \\right)^k
           \\left( \\frac{r}{r+m} \\right)^r

        However, :math:`k!` can be also be rewritten as
        :math:`\\Gamma(k+1)`, resulting in:

        .. math::

           PDF_{NB(k,m,r)} = \
           \\binom{\\Gamma(k+r)}{\\Gamma(r) \\cdot 
           \\Gamma(k+1)}
           \\left( \\frac{m}{r+m} \\right)^k
           \\left( \\frac{r}{r+m} \\right)^r

        Then, we get the natural logarithm of both sides:
        
        .. math::

           logPDF_{NB(k,m,r)} &= \
           log\\Gamma(k+r) - log\\Gamma(r) - log\\Gamma(k+1) \\\\
           &+ k \\cdot log \\left( \\frac{m}{r+m} \\right) +
           r \\cdot log \\left( \\frac{r}{r+m} \\right)
        
        Here, we are adding a small value :math:`\\epsilon` to prevent
        underflow/overflow:

        .. math::

           logPDF_{NB(k,m,r)} &= \
           log\\Gamma(k+r) - log\\Gamma(r) - log\\Gamma(k+1) \\\\
           &+ k \\cdot
           log \\left( m \\cdot \\frac{1}{r+m+\\epsilon} 
           + \\epsilon \\right) +
           r \\cdot
           log \\left( r \\cdot \\frac{1}{r+m+\\epsilon}
           \\right)

        Finally, we substitute :math:`\\frac{1}{r+m+\\epsilon}` with
        :math:`c` and we obtain:

        .. math::

           logPDF_{NB(k,m,r)} &= \
           log\\Gamma(k+r) - log\\Gamma(r) - log\\Gamma(k+1) \\\\
           &+ k \\cdot
           log \\left( m \\cdot c + \\epsilon \\right) +
           r \\cdot
           log \\left( r \\cdot c \\right)

        The loss corresponds to the negative log-probability mass of
        the negative binomial distributions - or, if ``contamination``
        is above zero, to that of a two-component mixture in which a
        small fraction of the counts come from something the model does
        not describe.

        WHY THE MIXTURE EXISTS, AND WHERE IT SHOULD AND SHOULD NOT BE
        USED.

        The negative log-probability is UNBOUNDED. A gene the model
        cannot predict at all does not contribute a large penalty, it
        contributes an arbitrarily large one, and the optimizer will pay
        almost anything elsewhere to reduce it. When what is being
        optimized is a REPRESENTATION - one point in the latent space,
        fitted to one sample - that means the handful of genes the model
        cannot reach get to decide where the point lands.

        For a tumour that is exactly the wrong outcome. The genes the
        model cannot reach are the aberrant ones, which is to say the
        SIGNAL, and letting them drag the representation gives back a
        counterfactual that has already absorbed part of what it was
        supposed to measure.

        The mixture bounds their influence. A gene that cannot be
        explained is explained as contamination instead, at a fixed
        cost, and the representation is then decided by the majority of
        genes that still look like the healthy tissue they came from.

        Measured on this model, the regimes really are different. Over
        healthy held-out GTEx the loss is almost evenly spread - the
        worst 0.1% of gene-sample pairs carry 0.35% of it, and the very
        worst pair is 31 times the median. Over TCGA tumours the pairs
        above a negative log-probability of 20 are ELEVEN TIMES more
        common, and over a tissue that is not in GTEx at all
        (age-related macular degeneration, whose tissue is retina) the
        worst 0.1% carry SIX TIMES the share.

        So: **TRAINING does not need this and should not use it** -
        there is nothing in healthy data with the leverage to justify
        it, and a contamination component free to absorb genes during
        training would teach the model less than it could learn.
        **FINDING REPRESENTATIONS for a new sample should**, and that is
        the only place it is switched on.

    a proper hierarchical prior whose width is LEARNED.

    'nb_full_dispersion_shrunk' writes the log-r-value as a per-gene
    baseline plus a per-sample deviation and penalizes the deviation
    with a fixed ``shrinkage_lambda``. That fixed strength is the whole
    of its trouble: it was measured fixing the tail of the null - a
    fourteen-fold inflation down to under two - and wrecking the bulk
    at the same time, five times too conservative where the test was
    already right, because ONE number decided how hard every gene in
    every sample was pulled back.

    A penalty of ``lambda * deviation^2`` is the negative log of a
    Gaussian prior on the deviation whose width is fixed at
    ``1/sqrt(2*lambda)``. Written that way what is missing is obvious,
    and so is the reason the strength could not simply be made a
    parameter: the prior's normalizing constant. With no ``log sigma``
    term, widening the prior only ever lowers the loss, so a free
    strength runs straight to no shrinkage at all.

    So this writes the prior properly:

        log r[gene, sample] = log r[gene] + deviation[gene, sample]
        deviation[gene, sample] ~ Normal(0, sigma[gene]^2)

    and adds its whole negative log-density, the ``log sigma``
    included. That makes ``sigma`` estimable, and it is estimated PER
    GENE: each gene learns how far its own dispersion may move from
    sample to sample, rather than inheriting one number chosen for all
    of them.

    The two modules it sits between are its own limiting cases. As
    ``sigma`` goes to zero the deviation is pinned and this becomes
    'nb_feature_dispersion', one dispersion per gene; as ``sigma``
    grows the prior stops constraining anything and this becomes
    'nb_full_dispersion'. Neither is imposed - a gene whose dispersion
    genuinely moves between samples keeps a wide ``sigma``, one whose
    does not gets a narrow one, and the likelihood decides which is
    which.

    Every term here belongs to the joint log-likelihood the model
    already maximizes, so nothing about the inference changes in kind:
    the representations are still found by the same MAP, with one more
    properly normalized prior in the objective.

            The width each gene's prior starts at, in log-r units.

            It starts narrow, so that training begins near the stable
            per-gene dispersion and widens only for the genes whose
            data ask for it. Starting wide would begin at the free
            per-sample dispersion, which is the thing being moved away

            The smallest width the prior may take.

            A gene whose deviations all went to zero would send its own
            ``sigma`` there too, and the ``log sigma`` term diverges
            when it arrives.

            It is 0.01 and not something smaller because the floor is
            not only a numerical guard, it is a statement about how
            tight a prior is meant to be believed. The per-sample
            log-r-values move by about 0.2 in natural-log units between
            two runs that differ only in a seed, so a width of 1e-3
            calls a perfectly ordinary deviation a two-hundred-sigma
            event and returns a penalty near 1e8. Training survived to
            epoch 151 at that floor and then went to NaN in a single

            How far a gene's width may wander from ``sigma_prior``, in
            natural-log units, before the prior objects.

            One is deliberately weak: it leaves a gene free to sit
            anywhere between roughly a third and three times
            ``sigma_prior`` without penalty worth the name, and only
            bites at the collapse the funnel drives towards.
