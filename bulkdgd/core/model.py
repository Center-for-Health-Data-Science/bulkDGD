    Without it, a single batch whose gradients are large enough can take
    the model out in one step - the loss becomes NaN, and stays NaN,
    since NaN propagates through every parameter it touches.

    The negative binomial output modules make that easy to run into. The
    log-probability mass contains ``lgamma(k+r) - lgamma(r)``, and a gene
    whose dispersion ``r`` is driven towards zero drives both terms
    towards infinity, so their difference is the difference of two
    infinities.

        The model is initialized on the CPU. To move the model to
        another device, modify the ``device`` property.

        Parameters
        ----------
        latent_dim : :class:`int`
            The dimensionality of the latent space.

        latent_type : :class:`str`, {``"lgmm"``, ``"tgmm"``}, \
            ``"tgmm"``
            The type of the latent space to use.

            The available options are:

            - ``"lgmm"``: the legacy Gaussian mixture model
                implementation, which uses the
                :class:`bulkdgd.core.latents.GaussianMixtureModelLegacy`
                class.

            - ``"tgmm"``: the TGMM Gaussian mixture model
                implementation, which uses the
                :class:`bulkdgd.core.latents.GaussianMixtureModelTGMM`
                class.

        latent_options : :class:`dict`
            The options for setting up the latent space.

            For the available options, refer to the
            :ref:`model_config_options` page.

        decoder_options : :class:`dict`
            The options for setting up the decoder.

            For the available options, refer to the
            :ref:`model_config_options` page.

        genes_txt_file : :class:`str`
            A plain text file containing the Ensembl IDs of the genes
            included in the model.

            Training data will be checked to ensure counts are
            reported for all genes.

            The number of output units in the decoder is initialized
            from the number of genes found in this file.

        scaling_factor : :class:`str`, \
            {``"mean"``, ``"median"``}, ``"mean"``
            How to compute the scaling factor of a sample - the number
            the decoder's predicted means are multiplied by to put them
            on the scale of the sample's own counts.

            The mean is not robust to the few genes that take a large
            and variable share of a library: in GTEx the thirteen
            mitochondrial genes take 14.49% of the reads, and their
            share runs from 0.10% to 90.85% between samples, which moves
            the mean by up to a factor of ten. The median is moved by
            at most 3.7% by the same genes. See
            :class:`bulkdgd.core.dataclasses.GeneExpressionDataset`.

            This belongs to the model and not to a single run of it.
            The median is about a third of the mean, and the decoder's
            output is fitted against whichever the model was trained
            with, so a model trained with one and used with the other
            has its predicted means wrong by about a factor of three -
            without failing. It is therefore written in the model's
            configuration file, so that finding representations,
            imputing, and the differential expression analysis all read
            the same value the training did.

        dtype : :class:`str`, \
            {``"float32"``, ``"float64"``}, ``"float32"``
            The precision the model's parameters are built in.

            This is not a preference that can be applied afterwards. A
            module's parameters are made in whatever torch's default
            dtype is at the moment the module is constructed, and
            ``load_state_dict`` copies a checkpoint INTO the parameters
            that are already there, casting as it goes - so a float64
            checkpoint read into a model built in float32 gives a
            float32 decoder, and nothing says so.

            The Gaussian mixture does not go quietly, which is the only
            piece of luck in it: ``tgmm`` keeps the tensors it is handed
            rather than copying into its own, so it stays float64 while
            the decoder becomes float32, and the first matrix multiply
            of the two raises ``mat1 and mat2 must have the same
            dtype``.

            Torch's default dtype is put back to what it was once the
            model is built: it is global, and a model asked for in
            double is not a reason for the rest of the program to be in
            double.

        device : :class:`str`, ``"cpu"``
            The device where the model will be initialized. The model
            is initialized on the CPU by default.

        """Get the scaling factor of a sample only some of whose genes
        were measured.

        The factor the model multiplies its predicted means by is the
        sample's MEAN COUNT OVER ALL OF ITS GENES. That is the quantity
        the decoder was trained against, and it is not negotiable: a
        different factor means the decoder's output means something
        different from what it was fitted to mean.

        The trouble is that a sample only part of which was measured
        does not have that quantity. The unmeasured genes are not in the
        sum, and taking the mean over the genes that ARE there - or, what
        is the same thing and what happens by default, taking the mean
        over all of them with the unmeasured ones entered as zeros -
        gives a number that is too small by however much of the
        transcriptome is absent. A thousand-gene panel of a fourteen-
        thousand-gene model would be scaled by about a fourteenth of
        what it should be, and every predicted mean would come out that
        much too low: the genes that WERE measured as much as the genes
        that were not, because there is one representation and it is
        fitted to all of them at once.

        So the missing part of the sum is filled in by the model. Write
        's' for the mean count over all G genes, 'M' for the genes that
        were measured, and 'mu_g = s * pred_g' for what the model says a
        gene's mean is. Then

            s * G  =  sum_{g in M} obs_g  +  sum_{g not in M} mu_g

                   =  sum_{g in M} obs_g  +  s * sum_{g not in M} pred_g

        and solving for the 's' on both sides,

                          sum_{g in M} obs_g
            s  =  --------------------------------
                   G  -  sum_{g not in M} pred_g

        which is what is returned. The observed genes carry their own
        counts; the unobserved ones are carried by the model's
        expectation of them, which is the only thing there is to carry
        them with.

        It is exact when everything is measured. The second sum is then
        empty, and 's' is 'sum(obs) / G' - the mean count over all the
        genes, the factor the model always used. The masked path is
        therefore a generalization of the unmasked one and not a rival to
        it, which is a thing worth being able to prove rather than claim:
        pass a mask of all ones and the answer must not move.

        THE MEDIAN. The argument above is an argument about a sum, and a
        median is not a sum, so it does not carry over. What carries over
        instead is something simpler. The fill-in exists because a PANEL
        is a biased sample of the transcriptome - a thousand genes chosen
        for being worth measuring are not a thousand genes drawn at
        random, and neither their mean nor their median estimates the
        whole sample's. But when the unmeasured genes are MISSING AT
        RANDOM, the measured ones are a uniform subsample, and their
        median estimates the median over all the genes directly, with no
        model and no equation to solve.

        So that is what is returned for a median-scaled model, and the
        condition attaches to it: **the mask must be random**. For a
        targeted panel it is biased, in the same direction and for the
        same reason the naive mean would be.

        It was worth checking rather than assuming, because the tempting
        alternative is wrong. Requiring 's' to be the median of the
        completed vector - the exact analogue of the equation the mean
        solves - has a closed-form solution ('s * pred_g <= s' is just
        'pred_g <= 1', so the unmeasured genes contribute a count that
        does not depend on 's' and the answer is an order statistic of
        the measured counts). It is elegant and it is biased by about
        20% low, because it fills the unmeasured half with noiseless
        expectations, and a median is moved by noise where a mean is not.
        Under a random mask the naive median lands on the unmasked one to
        within a count or two; that self-consistent one does not.

        rep : :class:`torch.Tensor`
            A tensor containing the optimized representations.

        component of the Gaussian mixture model per sample, optimizing
        these representations, selecting the best representation for
        for each sample, and optimizing these representations further.

        Parameters
        ----------
        dataset : \
            :class:`bulkdgd.core.dataclasses.GeneExpressionDataset`
            The dataset from which the data loader should be created.
    
        config : :class:`dict`
            A dictionary with the options to run the optimization.

        Returns
        -------
        rep : :class:`torch.Tensor`
            A tensor containing the optimized representations.

            This is a 2D tensor where:

            - The first dimension has a length equal to the number
              of samples.

            - The second dimension has a length equal to the
              dimensionality of the latent space where the
              representations live.

        pred_means : :class:`torch.Tensor`
            A tensor containing the predicted means of the
            distributions modelling the genes' counts.

            This is a 2D tensor where:

            - The first dimension has a length equal to the number
              of samples.

            - The second dimension has a length equal to the
              dimensionality of the gene space.

            If the genes counts are modelled using negative binomial
            distributions, the predicted means are scaled by the
            corresponding distributions' r-values.

        pred_r_values : :class:`torch.Tensor` or :obj:`None`
            A tensor containing the predicted r-values of the negative
            binomial distributions modelling the genes' counts, if
            the counts are modelled by negative binomial distributions.

            This is a 2D tensor where:

            - The first dimension has a length equal to the number
              of samples.

            - The second dimension has a length equal to the
              dimensionality of the gene space.

        representations looked like, one row per candidate.

        Every sample's representation is chosen by putting one candidate
        in each component of the Gaussian mixture model (or
        ``n_rep_per_comp`` of them), optimizing all of them, and keeping
        the one whose total loss is smallest. Only the winner survives
        ``argmin``. This is everything else.

        The columns are:

        * ``sample`` - the sample.

        * ``candidate`` - which of the ``n_rep_per_comp * n_components``
          candidates this row is.

        * ``born_in`` - the component the candidate started in.

        * ``arrived_in`` - the component that claims the candidate where
          it stood WHEN IT WAS JUDGED. It need not be ``born_in``: the
          candidates are optimized before they are compared, and they
          move.

        * ``settled_in`` - for the winner, the component that claims it
          after the SECOND optimization, which is where the
          representation that goes into every downstream analysis
          actually is. It is the same for every row of a sample.

        * ``recon_loss``, ``latent_loss``, ``total_loss`` - the losses,
          in nats, kept apart so that it is possible to see which of
          them decided.

        * ``is_winner`` - whether ``argmin`` picked this candidate.

        * ``margin`` - the total loss of this candidate minus the total
          loss of the winner, in nats. It is zero for the winner, and for
          the runner-up it is the number that says how close the thing
          came. This is the honest measure of how sure the model was.

        * ``softmax`` - ``softmax(-total_loss)`` over a sample's
          candidates.

          It is included because it was asked for, and it should be
          looked at once and then not trusted: the reconstruction loss is
          a sum over some sixteen thousand genes, so the gap between the
          winner and the runner-up is of the order of a hundred nats, and
          the softmax of that is 1.0 for the winner and 0.0 for everyone
          else, for every sample ever scored. A gap of twenty nats
          already gives 1 - 2e-9. Use ``margin``.

        Parameters
        ----------
        samples_names : :class:`list`, optional
            The samples' names, in the order the model was given them.

            values of the scaled means or additional information.

            The columns containing the scaled means must be
            named after the corresponding genes' Ensembl IDs.

        Parameters
        ----------
        df_samples : :class:`pandas.DataFrame`
            A data frame containing the samples.

        genes_mask : :class:`torch.Tensor`, optional
            A 2D tensor of 1.0 and 0.0, one row per sample and one
            column per gene, saying which of a sample's genes were
            MEASURED. If not passed, all of them were, which is what a
            whole transcriptome is.

            Most callers want :meth:`impute` instead, which builds the
            mask from the missing values of the data frame and returns
            the imputed counts. This argument is here for the caller who
            wants the representation itself.

        config_rep : :class:`dict`
            A dictionary of options for the optimization(s). It varies
            according to the selected ``method``.

            The supported options for all available methods can be
            found :doc:`here <../rep_config_options>`.

            Whether to also compute and return the saliency maps
            showing the importance of each latent dimension for each
            gene's expression based on the obtained representations.
            Default: ``False``.

        Returns
        -------
        df_rep : :class:`pandas.DataFrame`
            A data frame containing the representations.

            Here, each row contains a representation and the
            columns contain either the values of the representations'
            along the latent space's dimensions or additional
            information about the input samples found in the
            input data frame. Columns containing additional
            information, if present in the input data frame, will
            appear last in the data frame.

        df_pred_means : :class:`pandas.DataFrame`
            A data frame containing the predicted means of the
            distributions modelling the genes' counts for the
            representations found.

            Here, each row contains the predicted means for a
            given representation, and the columns contain either the
            mean of a distribution or additional information about the
            input samples found in the input data frame. Columns
            containing additional information, if present in the input
            data frame, will appear last in the data frame.

            If the genes counts are modelled using negative binomial
            distributions, the predicted means are scaled by the
            corresponding distributions' r-values.

        df_pred_r_values : :class:`pandas.DataFrame`, optional
            A data frame containing the predicted r-values of the
            negative binomials for the representations found, if the
            genes' counts are modelled by negative binomial
            distributions

            Here, each row contains the predicted r-values for a given
            representation, and the columns contain either the
            r-value of a negative binomial or additional information
            about the input samples found in the input
            data frame. Columns containing additional
            information, if present in the input data frame, will
            appear last in the data frame.

            ``df_pred_r_values`` is :obj:`None` if the genes' counts
            are modelled by Poisson distributions.

        df_time : :class:`pandas.DataFrame`
            A data frame containing data about the CPU and wall
            clock time used by each epoch (and backpropagation
            step within each epoch) in each optimization step.

            Here, each row represents an epoch of an optimization
            step, and the columns contain data about the platform
            where the calculation was run, the number of CPU threads
            used by the computation, and the CPU and wall clock
            time used by the entire epoch and by the backpropagation
            step run inside it.

        df_saliency_map : :class:`pandas.DataFrame`, optional
            A data frame containing the gradients indicating the
            importance of each latent dimension for each gene's
            expression.
            
            Here, each row is a gene (indexed by ENSG naming) and

        """Predict the counts of the genes a sample does not have.

        A sample only part of whose transcriptome was read - a gene
        panel, a targeted assay - is given, the genes that were read are
        used to find its representation, and the decoder is asked for
        the genes that were not.

        THE MISSING GENES MUST BE MISSING, and not zero. A gene whose
        count is :obj:`numpy.nan` was never measured; a gene whose count
        is 0 was measured and found to be silent. They are different
        facts, and the difference is the whole of this method: a zero is
        evidence, and the model will move a sample's representation in
        order to explain it. Hand it a panel with the unmeasured genes
        written as zeros and it will conclude that the sample has
        switched off nine tenths of its transcriptome - and it will
        conclude it about the genes that WERE measured too, because the
        representation is one thing and it is fitted to all of them at
        once.

        So the unmeasured genes are taken out of the likelihood
        altogether, which for a factorized likelihood is exactly what
        conditioning on the genes that were measured means, and the
        scaling factor of the negative binomials - which is otherwise
        the mean count over ALL of the genes, and would be deflated by
        every gene that is not there - is estimated from the measured
        genes alone.

        Parameters
        ----------
        df_samples : :class:`pandas.DataFrame`
            The samples, with :obj:`numpy.nan` in the genes that were
            not measured.

            A column of genes may be missing from the data frame
            entirely; it is taken to have been measured in no sample.

        config_rep : :class:`dict`
            The options for finding the representations, as for
            :meth:`get_representations`.

        genes_measured : :class:`list`, optional
            The genes that were measured, if it is more convenient to
            say so than to write :obj:`numpy.nan` everywhere else. Every
            other gene is taken to be unmeasured in every sample.

        quantiles : :class:`tuple`, optional
            The quantiles of the predicted negative binomial to report,
            which give the imputed count an interval and not only a
            point. Default: the central 95%.

        Returns
        -------
        df_imputed : :class:`pandas.DataFrame`
            The expected count of every gene of every sample, on that

            gene the model is uncertain of looks exactly like a gene it
            is sure of.

            The r-values of those negative binomials.

            is what is needed to ask where an observed count LANDS in
            what the model expected, which is the question a
            differential expression analysis asks, and the question by
            which an imputation is honestly judged.

        distribution representations exist (tumour, metastatic, ...) -
        not just the healthy ones.

        The only approximation is the "no variance" threshold, and it is
        verified: the pruned decoder is run against the full one on the
        real representations, and the run raises if the maximum relative
        error on the outputs (the means and the log-r-values) exceeds
        ``verification_tol``.

        The latent space (the Gaussian mixture model) is *not* touched -
        pruning is a property of the decoder alone. The pruned model
        returned by this method points at the same ``gmm_pth_file`` its
        parent used.

        Parameters
        ----------
        input_reps : :class:`str`, :class:`pandas.DataFrame`, or a \
            :class:`list` of either
            The representations that make up the probe set. Each may be
            a path to a CSV file (samples on the rows, the latent
            dimensions in columns named ``latent_dim_*``, as written by
            :meth:`get_representations`) or an in-memory
            :class:`pandas.DataFrame` in the same format. Pass all the
            representations the model has produced, in and out of
            distribution - see the note above.

        config_prune : :class:`dict`
            The configuration for the pruning. The keys are:

            * ``"gmm_pth_file"`` (:class:`str`) - the file with the
              trained latent space's parameters. It is referenced by the
              pruned model unchanged; the latent space is not pruned.

            * ``"dec_pth_file"`` (:class:`str`) - the file with the
              trained decoder's parameters. These are the parameters
              that get pruned.

            * ``"dec_pruned_pth_file"`` (:class:`str`) - the file where
              the pruned decoder's parameters will be written.

            * ``"config_model_pruned"`` (:class:`str`) - the YAML file
              where the pruned model's configuration will be written. It
              can be loaded later to rebuild the pruned model.

            * ``"pruning_options"`` (:class:`dict`, optional) - the
              options controlling the pruning:

              - ``"rel_tol"`` (:class:`float`, default ``1e-7``): a unit
                is kept when its footprint (its activation's standard
                deviation across the probes, times the norm of its
                outgoing weights) is at least this fraction of the
                largest footprint in its layer.
              - ``"verification_tol"`` (:class:`float`, default
                ``1e-4``): the maximum relative error, on the real
                representations, that the pruned decoder is allowed
                before the method raises.
              - ``"n_jitter_copies"`` (:class:`int`, default ``2``): how
                many Gaussian-jittered copies of the probes to add, so a
                unit that is only ever *nearly* constant on the observed
                representations is still exercised.
              - ``"jitter_sd"`` (:class:`float`, default ``0.25``): the
                scale of the jitter, as a fraction of each latent
                dimension's standard deviation.
              - ``"seed"`` (:class:`int`, default ``0``): the seed for
                the jitter, so the pruning is reproducible.

        Returns
        -------
        pruned_model : :class:`BulkDGD`
            A new model whose decoder has been pruned to its live units.
            Its parameters have already been written to
            ``dec_pruned_pth_file`` and ``config_model_pruned``, so it
            can also be rebuilt from those files later.

        Parameters
        ----------
        df_samples : :class:`pandas.DataFrame`
            A data frame containing the samples.

            Each row should contain a unique sample, and each
            column should either contain a gene's expression for that
            sample (if the column is named after the gene's Ensembl
            ID) or additional information about the sample.

        names_train : :class:`list`
            A list of the names of the training samples, which should
            be a subset of the names of the samples in the input data
            frame.
        
        names_test : :class:`list`
            A list of the names of the test samples, which should be a
            subset of the names of the samples in the input data frame.

        config_train : :class:`dict`
            A dictionary of options for the training.

        gmm_pth_file : :class:`str`, ``"gmm.pth"``
            The .pth file where to save the GMM's trained parameters
            (means of the components, weights of the components,
            and log-variance of the components).

        dec_pth_file : :class:`str`, ``"dec.pth"``
            The .pth file where to save the decoder's trained
            parameters (weights and biases).

        gmm_final_pth_file : :class:`str`, ``"gmm_final.pth"``
            The .pth file where to save the parameters of the Gaussian
            mixture model fitted to the representations after
            training.

            It is only written if the model's configuration has a
            ``gmm_final`` section. It is a **separate** file from
            ``gmm_pth_file``, which keeps the prior the model was
            trained with: finding a representation for a new sample
            goes through the prior, and swapping the two would put a
            mixture fitted to the representations in charge of
            producing them.

        pathways : :class:`dict`, optional
            A dictionary where the keys are pathway names and the
            values are lists of genes' Ensembl IDs belonging to
            each pathway.
            
            It is needed if ``save_pathways_saliency_maps_epoch`` is
            set to :obj:`True`.
        
        labels_train : :class:`numpy.ndarray`, optional
            The ground-truth labels for the training samples.
        
        labels_test : :class:`numpy.ndarray`, optional
            The ground-truth labels for the test samples.

        Returns
        -------
        dfs_rep : :class:`tuple`
            A tuple ``(df_rep_train, df_rep_test)`` with the optimized
            latent representations for training and testing samples.

        dfs_pred_means : :class:`tuple`
            A tuple ``(df_pred_means_train, df_pred_means_test)`` with
            the predicted decoder means for training and testing
            samples.

        dfs_pred_r_values  : :obj:`None` or \
            :class:`pandas.DataFrame` or :class:`tuple`
            The predicted r-values, depending on the output module:

            - :obj:`None` for
              :class:`bulkdgd.core.outputmodules.OutputModulePoisson`.
            - A single :class:`pandas.DataFrame` for

              df_pred_r_values_test)`` for
              :class:`bulkdgd.core.outputmodules.OutputModuleNBFullDispersion`.

        df_loss : :class:`pandas.DataFrame`
            A data frame containing the losses calculated during
            training.
        
        dfs_metrics : :obj:`None` or :class:`tuple`
            The per-epoch metrics rows for training and testing
            samples, depending on whether the user requested to
            calculate metrics during training:

            - :obj:`None` if the user did not request to calculate
              metrics during training.
            - A tuple ``(df_metrics_train, df_metrics_test)`` of
              data frames, where each data frame contains the
              metrics calculated for the training or test samples in a
              given epoch, if the user requested to calculate metrics
              during training.

        df_time : :class:`pandas.DataFrame`
            A data frame containing the training-time metrics.
