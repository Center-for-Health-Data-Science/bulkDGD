    Parameters
    ----------
    csv_file : :class:`str`
        A CSV file containing a data frame with the decoder's outputs.

        Each row should represent the decoder's output for a given
        representation, while each column should contain either the
        values of the output or additional information about it.

    sep : :class:`str`, ``","``
        The column separator in the input CSV file.

    split : :class:`bool`, :class:`True`
        Whether to split the input data frame into two data frames,
        one with only the columns containing the decoder's outputs
        and the other containing only the columns with additional
        information, if any were found.

    Returns
    -------    
    df_data : :class:`pandas.DataFrame`
        A data frame containing the decoder's outputs.

        Here, each row represents the decoder's output for a given
        representation. and the columns contain the values
        of the output.

        If ``split`` is :class:`False`, this data frame will contain
        also the columns with additional information about the
        output, if any were found.

    df_other_data : :class:`pandas.DataFrame`
        A data frame containing additional information about the
        decoder's outputs found in the input data frame.

        Here, each row represents the decoder's output for a given
        representations and the columns contain additional
        information provided in the input data frame.

        If ``split`` is :class:`False`, only ``df_data`` is returned.
