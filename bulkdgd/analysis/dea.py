    ----------
    obs_counts : :class:`pandas.Series`
        Observed gene counts, indexed by Ensembl ID or metadata field.

    pred_means : :class:`pandas.Series`
        Predicted means of the genes' count distributions.

    r_values : :class:`pandas.Series`, optional
        Predicted r-values of the negative binomial distributions;

    resolution : :class:`int`, optional
        Coarseness of the p-value sum over the probability mass
        function; exact if not passed.

    return_pmf_values : :class:`bool`, :obj:`False`
        Also return the evaluation points and values of the log-
        probability mass function; forces per-gene, CPU-only
        computation, ignoring ``device``.

    pseudocount : :class:`int`, ``1``
        Pseudocount added to observed counts and predicted means to
        avoid artifacts.

    device : :class:`str` or :class:`torch.device`, ``"cpu"``
        Device on which to compute the p-values.

    p_values_method : :class:`str`, ``"auto"``
        How to compute the p-values: ``"batched"`` (all genes at
        once, GPU-capable), ``"per-gene"``, or ``"auto"``.

    max_elements : :class:`int`, optional
        Cap on points evaluated per batch by the ``"batched"``
        method, to limit memory use.

    scaling_factor : :class:`str`, \
        {``"mean"``, ``"median"``}, ``"mean"``
        How the model scales a sample's predicted means to the
        scale of the sample's own counts.

    two_sided : :class:`str`, \
        {``"equal_tail"``, ``"density"``}, ``"equal_tail"``
        How the two tails are combined into one p-value:
        ``"equal_tail"`` doubles the smaller tail, ``"density"`` sums
        every outcome no more likely than the observed one.

    mid_p : :class:`bool`, ``True``
        Whether to apply the mid-p correction under the
        ``"equal_tail"`` rule.

    Returns
    -------
    p_values : :class:`pandas.Series`
        One p-value per gene.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obs_counts : :class:`pandas.DataFrame`

        Ensembl ID or metadata field (columns).

        like ``obs_counts``.

    r_values : :class:`pandas.DataFrame`, optional
        Predicted r-values of the negative binomial distributions,
        shaped like ``obs_counts``; if omitted, the counts are taken
        to be Poisson-distributed.

    resolution : :class:`int`, optional
        Coarseness of the p-value sum over the probability mass
        function; exact if not passed.

    alpha : :class:`float`, ``0.05``
        The family-wise error rate for the calculation of the
        q-values (adjusted p-values).

    method : :class:`str`, ``"fdr_bh"``
        The method used to calculate the q-values (see
        ``statsmodels.stats.multitest.multipletests``).

    p_val : :class:`float`, ``0.05``
        The p-value threshold to consider a gene as significant.

        The q-value threshold to consider a gene as significant.

    log2_fold_change : :class:`float`, ``2``
        The log2-fold change threshold (positive and negative) to
        consider a gene as significant.

    genes_sets : :class:`dict`, optional
        Named sets of genes of interest, as gene-set name -> list of
        gene names.

    pseudocount : :class:`int`, ``1``
        Pseudocount added to observed counts and predicted means to
        avoid artifacts.

        Device on which to compute the p-values.

    p_values_method : :class:`str`, ``"auto"``
        How to compute the p-values: ``"batched"`` (all genes at
        once, GPU-capable), ``"per-gene"``, or ``"auto"``.

    max_elements : :class:`int`, optional
        Cap on points evaluated per batch by the ``"batched"``
        method, to limit memory use.

    scaling_factor : :class:`str`, \
        {``"mean"``, ``"median"``}, ``"mean"``
        How the model scales a sample's predicted means to the
        scale of the sample's own counts.
