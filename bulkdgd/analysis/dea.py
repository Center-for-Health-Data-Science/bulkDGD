    """Utilities to perform differential expression analysis (DEA).

    .. warning::

       **The default two-sided rule changed in July 2026, and it
       changes results.**

       ``get_p_values``, ``get_statistics`` and ``perform_dea`` now
       take ``two_sided``, which defaults to ``"equal_tail"``. It used
       to be a density region - the total probability mass of every
       outcome no more likely than the observed one - and that is now
       ``two_sided = "density"``.

       A density region is the right two-sided test for a symmetric
       distribution and a poor one for a skewed discrete distribution.
       The region it picks is lopsided in log space and always the same
       way, because a two-fold INCREASE is a deviation of +m from the
       mean while a two-fold DECREASE is a deviation of only -m/2. On
       simulated counts with a symmetric perturbation the density
       region called 63.7 genes up for every 1 down; the equal-tail
       rule called 1.45.

       Pass ``two_sided = "density"`` to reproduce anything computed
       before the change.

       The new rule is also about 180 times faster - 0.23 s a sample
       against 41 s - because the tails come from the cumulative
       distribution function in closed form rather than from
       enumerating a grid, and it needs neither ``resolution`` nor
       ``max_elements`` nor a GPU.

    """Get the factor a sample's predicted means are multiplied by to
    put them on the scale of the sample's own counts.

    The decoder does not emit counts. It emits a sample's profile, and
    the profile is multiplied by one number per sample to become the
    counts the sample actually has. That number is a property of the
    MODEL, not of this analysis: the decoder was fitted against it, and
    undoing it here with a different one leaves every predicted mean
    wrong by the ratio of the two - about a factor of three between the
    median and the mean - while every p-value still comes out looking
    like a p-value.

    This is why 'scaling_factor' has to be carried from the model's own
    configuration file to here, and why it is not simply assumed.

    """Calculate the p-value for all the genes in a sample at once.

    This is a vectorized re-formulation of :func:`_yield_p_values`. It
    evaluates the log-probability mass function of all the genes'
    distributions in a batch instead of gene by gene, which makes the
    calculation suitable for running on a GPU.

    The p-value of a gene depends only on that gene's distribution, so
    the genes are independent of each other, and the calculation
    parallelizes exactly.

    The genes' distributions have different tails, so the points at
    which the log-probability mass function needs to be evaluated form
    a "ragged" set. Here, the genes are sorted by the length of their
    set of points and split into chunks. Inside a chunk, the sets of
    points are padded to the length of the longest one, and the
    log-probability mass at the padded points is set to negative
    infinity so that it contributes zero probability mass. Sorting the
    genes beforehand keeps the amount of padding (and, therefore, the
    amount of wasted computation) small.

    r_values : :class:`numpy.ndarray`, optional
        A one-dimensional array containing the r-values for the genes.

    resolution : :class:`int`, optional
        The resolution at which to perform the p-value calculation.

    device : :class:`str` or :class:`torch.device`, ``"cpu"``
        The device on which to perform the calculation.

    max_elements : :class:`int`, ``2**26``
        The maximum number of points at which the log-probability mass

    The alternative to :func:`_compute_p_values`, which sums the
    probability mass of every outcome no more likely than the observed
    one - a DENSITY REGION - and is what this module did originally.

    A density region is the right two-sided test for a symmetric
    distribution and is a poor one for a skewed discrete distribution,
    which is what a negative binomial with a small mean is. The region
    it selects is lopsided in log space, and the lopsidedness runs one
    way: a two-fold INCREASE is a deviation of +m from the mean, and a
    two-fold DECREASE is a deviation of only -m/2. The standard
    deviation is much the same either way, so the same nominal fold
    change carries about twice the evidence upwards.

    Measured over 40 TCGA samples, the shipped density region called
    38.7 genes up for every 1 down. This rule called 12.9. Neither is
    1 - see 'results/<model>/call_asymmetry/FINDINGS.md' for what
    accounts for the rest - but the difference is a rule and not a
    model, and it costs nothing.

    The tails are computed exactly from the cumulative distribution
    function rather than by enumerating a grid, so this is also a good
    deal faster than the density region and needs no 'resolution' and
    no cap on the memory used.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obs_counts : :class:`numpy.ndarray`
        A one-dimensional array containing the observed counts for the
        genes.

    pred_means : :class:`numpy.ndarray`
        A one-dimensional array containing the predicted scaled mean
        counts for the genes.

    r_values : :class:`numpy.ndarray`, optional
        A one-dimensional array containing the r-values for the genes.
        If not passed, the counts are taken to be Poisson-distributed.

    mid_p : :class:`bool`, ``True``
        Whether to apply the mid-p correction, which counts half of the
        probability mass at the observed count instead of all of it.

        A two-sided test on a discrete distribution is conservative -
        its actual size is below the nominal one - because the mass at
        the observed value is counted whole in both tails. The mid-p
        correction removes most of that conservatism, and it matters
        here because the genes where the discreteness bites are exactly
        the low-mean genes where the asymmetry lives.

    """Given the observed gene counts in a single sample, and the
    predicted mean gene counts in a single sample, calculate the
    p-value associated with the predicted mean of each distribution
    modeling a gene's counts by comparing it to the actual gene count.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obs_counts : :class:`pandas.Series`
        The observed gene counts in a single sample.

        This is a series whose index contains either the genes'
        Ensembl IDs or names of fields containing additional
        information about the sample.

    pred_means : :class:`pandas.Series`
        The predicted means of the distributions modelling
        the genes' counts in a single sample.

        This is a series whose index contains either the genes'
        Ensembl IDs or names of fields containing additional
        information about the sample.

        If the genes' counts were modelled using negative binomial
        distributions, the predicted means are scaled by the
        corresponding distributions' r-values.

    r_values : :class:`pandas.Series`, optional
        The predicted r-values of the negative binomial distributions
        modelling the genes' counts in a single sample, if the genes'
        counts were modelled using negative binomial distributions.

        This is a series whose index contains either the genes'
        Ensembl IDs or names of fields containing additional
        information about the sample.

        If ``r_values`` is not provided, it is assumed that the genes'
        counts were modelled using Poisson distributions.

    resolution : :class:`int`, optional
        How accurate the calculation of the p-values should be.

        The ``resolution`` corresponds to the coarseness of the sum
        over the probability mass function of each distribution
        to compute the corresponding p-value.

        The higher the ``resolution``, the more accurate (and more
        computationally expensive) the calculation of the p-values
        will be.

        If not passed, the calculation will be exact.

    return_pmf_values : :class:`bool`, :obj:`False`
        Return the points at which the log-probability mass function
        was evaluated and the corresponding values of the log-
        probability mass function, together with the p-values.

        Set it to ``True`` only if you have a low resolution
        (for instance, ``1e3`` or lower) or a lot of RAM available
        since the arrays containing the points at which the log-
        probability mass function was evaluated and the corresponding
        values of the function will contain ``resolution``
        floating-point numbers for each gene.

        Setting it to ``True`` forces the p-values to be computed gene
        by gene on the CPU, ignoring ``device``.

    pseudocount : :class:`int`, ``1``
        A pseudocount to add to both the predicted means and observed
        counts to avoid artifacts.

    device : :class:`str` or :class:`torch.device`, ``"cpu"``
        The device on which to compute the p-values.

        The genes are independent of each other, so the calculation of
        the p-values parallelizes exactly, and running it on a GPU
        (for instance, by passing ``"cuda"``) speeds it up
        considerably.

        It is ignored if ``return_pmf_values`` is ``True``.

    p_values_method : :class:`str`, ``"auto"``
        How to compute the p-values. The methods give the same
        p-values, but differ in how they use the machine.

        ``"batched"`` computes the p-values for all the genes at once.
        This is what allows them to be computed on a GPU. On a CPU,
        :mod:`torch` spreads the computation over the cores by itself,
        so it should be used in a single process.

        ``"per-gene"`` computes the p-values one gene at a time. It is
        meant to be parallelized over the samples - by
        :func:`perform_dea`'s caller, or by ``bulkdgd_dea``'s ``-n``
        option - which is how to use a machine with many cores.

        The two kinds of parallelism do not compose: several processes
        each running a ``"batched"`` computation would fight over the
        CPU's cores, and the result would be slower than either kind of
        parallelism on its own.

        ``"auto"`` uses ``"batched"`` on a GPU, and ``"per-gene"`` on a
        CPU for the exact calculation (where the batch would have to be
        padded), and ``"batched"`` on a CPU otherwise.

    max_elements : :class:`int`, optional
        The maximum number of points at which the log-probability mass
        function is evaluated in one batch, which caps the memory used
        by the ``"batched"`` method.

        If not passed, it defaults to ``2**26`` on a GPU and ``2**22``
        on a CPU, where the batch sits in RAM that several processes
        may be sharing.

    scaling_factor : :class:`str`, \
        {``"mean"``, ``"median"``}, ``"mean"``
        How the model computes the scaling factor of a sample - the
        number its predicted means are multiplied by to reach the scale
        of the sample's own counts.

        It must be the one the model was **trained** with, which is in
        the model's own configuration file as ``"scaling_factor"``. The
        decoder is fitted against it, and undoing it here with the
        other one leaves every predicted mean wrong by the ratio of the
        two - about three, between the median and the mean - while
        every p-value still looks like a p-value.

    two_sided : :class:`str`, \
        {``"equal_tail"``, ``"density"``}, ``"equal_tail"``
        How the two tails are combined into one p-value.

        ``"equal_tail"`` doubles the smaller tail. ``"density"`` sums
        the probability mass of every outcome no more likely than the
        observed one.

        **The default changed to** ``"equal_tail"`` **in July 2026, and
        it changes results.** A density region is the right two-sided
        test for a symmetric distribution and a poor one for a skewed
        discrete distribution: the region it picks is lopsided in log
        space, and always the same way, because a two-fold increase is
        a deviation of +m from the mean while a two-fold decrease is a
        deviation of only -m/2.

        Over 40 TCGA samples the density region called 38.7 genes up
        for every 1 down and this rule called 12.9. Pass
        ``"density"`` to reproduce results produced before the change.

        See ``results/<model>/call_asymmetry/FINDINGS.md`` for what
        accounts for the remaining asymmetry, which is NOT this.

    mid_p : :class:`bool`, ``True``
        Whether to apply the mid-p correction when ``two_sided`` is
        ``"equal_tail"``, counting half the probability mass at the
        observed count rather than all of it in each tail.

        A two-sided test on a discrete distribution is conservative
        without it, and the genes where the discreteness bites are the
        low-mean genes where the asymmetry lives.

    Returns
    -------
    p_values : :class:`pandas.Series`
        A series containing one p-value per gene.
    
    ks : :class:`pandas.DataFrame`
        A data frame containing the count values at which the log-
        probability mass function was evaluated to compute the
        p-values.

        The data frame has as many rows as the number of genes and as
        many columns as the number of count values.

        This is an empty data frame if ``return_pmf_values`` is
        ``False``.
    
    pmfs : :class:`numpy.ndarray`
        A data frame containing the value of the log-probability mass
        function for each count value at which it was evaluated.

        The data frame has as many rows as the number of genes and as
        many columns as the number of count values.

        This is an empty data frame if ``return_pmf_values`` is

    Parameters
    ----------
    obs_counts : :class:`pandas.Series`
        The observed gene counts in a single sample.

        This is a series whose index contains either the genes'
        Ensembl IDs or names of fields containing additional
        information about the sample.

    pred_means : :class:`pandas.Series`
        The predicted means of the distributions modelling
        the genes' counts in a single sample.

        This is a series whose index contains either the genes'
        Ensembl IDs or names of fields containing additional
        information about the sample.

        If the genes' counts were modelled using negative binomial
        distributions, the predicted means are scaled by the
        corresponding distributions' r-values.

    r_values : :class:`pandas.Series`, optional
        The predicted r-values of the negative binomial distributions
        modelling the genes' counts in a single sample, if the genes'
        counts were modelled using negative binomial distributions.

        This is a series whose index contains either the genes'
        Ensembl IDs or names of fields containing additional
        information about the sample.

        If ``r_values`` is not provided, it is assumed that the genes'
        counts were modelled using Poisson distributions.

    sample_name : :class:`str`, optional
        The name of the sample under consideration.

        It is returned together with the results of the analysis
        to facilitate the identification of the sample when running
        the analysis in parallel for multiple samples (i.e., launching
        the function in parallel on multiple samples).

    statistics : :class:`list`, \
        {``["p_values", "q_values", "log2_fold_changes"]``}
        The statistics to be computed. By default, all of them
        will be computed.

    resolution : :class:`int`, optional
        How accurate the calculation of the p-values should be.

        The ``resolution`` corresponds to the coarseness of the sum
        over the probability mass function of each distribution
        to compute the corresponding p-value.

        The higher the ``resolution``, the more accurate (and more
        computationally expensive) the calculation of the p-values
        will be.

        If not passed, the calculation will be exact.

    alpha : :class:`float`, ``0.05``
        The family-wise error rate for the calculation of the
        q-values (adjusted p-values).

    method : :class:`str`, ``"fdr_bh"``
        The method used to calculate the q-values (in other words, to
        adjust the p-values). The available methods are listed in the
        documentation for
        ``statsmodels.stats.multitest.multipletests``.
    
    pseudocount : :class:`int`, ``1``
        A pseudocount to add to both the predicted means and observed
        counts to avoid artifacts.

    device : :class:`str` or :class:`torch.device`, ``"cpu"``
        The device on which to compute the p-values.

        The genes are independent of each other, so the calculation of
        the p-values parallelizes exactly, and running it on a GPU
        (for instance, by passing ``"cuda"``) speeds it up
        considerably.

    p_values_method : :class:`str`, ``"auto"``
        How to compute the p-values. The methods give the same
        p-values, but differ in how they use the machine.

        ``"batched"`` computes the p-values for all the genes at once.
        This is what allows them to be computed on a GPU. On a CPU,
        :mod:`torch` spreads the computation over the cores by itself,
        so it should be used in a single process.

        ``"per-gene"`` computes the p-values one gene at a time. It is
        meant to be parallelized over the samples - by
        :func:`perform_dea`'s caller, or by ``bulkdgd_dea``'s ``-n``
        option - which is how to use a machine with many cores.

        The two kinds of parallelism do not compose: several processes
        each running a ``"batched"`` computation would fight over the
        CPU's cores, and the result would be slower than either kind of
        parallelism on its own.

        ``"auto"`` uses ``"batched"`` on a GPU, and ``"per-gene"`` on a
        CPU for the exact calculation (where the batch would have to be
        padded), and ``"batched"`` on a CPU otherwise.

    max_elements : :class:`int`, optional
        The maximum number of points at which the log-probability mass
        function is evaluated in one batch, which caps the memory used
        by the ``"batched"`` method.

        If not passed, it defaults to ``2**26`` on a GPU and ``2**22``
        on a CPU, where the batch sits in RAM that several processes
        may be sharing.

    scaling_factor : :class:`str`, \
        {``"mean"``, ``"median"``}, ``"mean"``
        How the model computes the scaling factor of a sample - the
        number its predicted means are multiplied by to reach the scale
        of the sample's own counts.

        It must be the one the model was **trained** with, which is in
        the model's own configuration file as ``"scaling_factor"``. The
        decoder is fitted against it, and undoing it here with the
        other one leaves every predicted mean wrong by the ratio of the
        two - about three, between the median and the mean - while
        every p-value still looks like a p-value.

    Returns
    -------
    df_stats : :class:`pandas.DataFrame`
        A data frame whose rows represent the genes on which the DEA

        computed (p-values, q_values, log2-fold changes). If not all
        statistics were computed, the columns corresponding to the
        missing ones will be empty.

    """Perform differential expression analysis (DEA) on multiple
    samples.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obs_counts : :class:`pandas.DataFrame`
        The observed gene counts in multiple sample.

        This is a data frame whose index contains the samples's names,
        and the columns contain either the genes' Ensembl IDs or
        names of fields containing additional information about the
        samples.
    
    pred_means : :class:`pandas.DataFrame`
        The predicted means of the distributions modelling the genes'
        counts in each sample.

        This is a data frame whose index contains the samples' names,
        and the columns contain either the genes' Ensembl IDs or
        names of fields containing additional information about the
        samples.
    
    r_values : :class:`pandas.DataFrame`, optional
        The predicted r-values of the negative binomial distributions
        modelling the genes' counts in each sample, if the genes'
        counts were modelled using negative binomial distributions.

        This is a data frame whose index contains the samples' names,
        and the columns contain either the genes' Ensembl IDs or
        names of fields containing additional information about the
        samples.

        If ``r_values`` is not provided, it is assumed that the genes'
        counts were modelled using Poisson distributions.
    
    resolution : :class:`int`, optional
        How accurate the calculation of the p-values should be.

        The ``resolution`` corresponds to the coarseness of the sum
        over the probability mass function of each distribution
        to compute the corresponding p-value.

        The higher the ``resolution``, the more accurate (and more
        computationally expensive) the calculation of the p-values
        will be.

        If not passed, the calculation will be exact.
    
    alpha : :class:`float`, ``0.05``
        The family-wise error rate for the calculation of the
        q-values (adjusted p-values).
    
    method : :class:`str`, ``"fdr_bh"``
        The method used to calculate the q-values (in other words, to
        adjust the p-values). The available methods are listed in the
        documentation for
        ``statsmodels.stats.multitest.multipletests``.
    
    p_val : :class:`float`, ``0.05``
        The p-value threshold to consider a gene as significant.
    
    q_val : :class:`float`, ``0.05``
        The q-value threshold to consider a gene as significant.
    
    log2_fold_change : :class:`float`, ``2``
        The log2-fold change threshold to consider a gene as
        significant. This value and its negative are used as the
        thresholds for the log2-fold change.
    
    genes_sets : :class:`dict`, optional
        A dictionary containing sets of genes of interest.

        The keys are the names of the gene sets, and the values are
        lists of genes.
    
    pseudocount : :class:`int`, ``1``
        A pseudocount to add to both the predicted means and observed
        counts to avoid artifacts.

    device : :class:`str` or :class:`torch.device`, ``"cpu"``
        The device on which to compute the p-values.

        The genes are independent of each other, so the calculation of
        the p-values parallelizes exactly, and running it on a GPU
        (for instance, by passing ``"cuda"``) speeds it up
        considerably.

    p_values_method : :class:`str`, ``"auto"``
        How to compute the p-values. The methods give the same
        p-values, but differ in how they use the machine.

        ``"batched"`` computes the p-values for all the genes at once.
        This is what allows them to be computed on a GPU. On a CPU,
        :mod:`torch` spreads the computation over the cores by itself,
        so it should be used in a single process.

        ``"per-gene"`` computes the p-values one gene at a time. It is
        meant to be parallelized over the samples, which is how to use
        a machine with many cores.

        The two kinds of parallelism do not compose: several processes
        each running a ``"batched"`` computation would fight over the
        CPU's cores, and the result would be slower than either kind of
        parallelism on its own.

        ``"auto"`` uses ``"batched"`` on a GPU, and ``"per-gene"`` on a
        CPU for the exact calculation (where the batch would have to be
        padded), and ``"batched"`` on a CPU otherwise.

    max_elements : :class:`int`, optional
        The maximum number of points at which the log-probability mass
        function is evaluated in one batch, which caps the memory used
        by the ``"batched"`` method.

        If not passed, it defaults to ``2**26`` on a GPU and ``2**22``
        on a CPU, where the batch sits in RAM that several processes
        may be sharing.

    scaling_factor : :class:`str`, \
        {``"mean"``, ``"median"``}, ``"mean"``
        How the model computes the scaling factor of a sample - the
        number its predicted means are multiplied by to reach the scale
        of the sample's own counts.

        It must be the one the model was **trained** with, which is in
        the model's own configuration file as ``"scaling_factor"``. The
        decoder is fitted against it, and undoing it here with the
        other one leaves every predicted mean wrong by the ratio of the
        two - about three, between the median and the mean - while
        every p-value still looks like a p-value.

    dfs_stats : :class:`dict`
        A dictionary containing the data frames with the statistics

        A series containing the significant genes per sample.

        A data frame containing the enrichment scores for each sample.
