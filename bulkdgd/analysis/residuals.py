    """Calculate the residuals of many samples at once.

    This is :func:`get_residuals`, which takes one sample and walks its
    genes one at a time in Python. That is fine for a sample and slow for
    a study: ten thousand samples of fifteen thousand genes is a hundred
    and fifty million turns of that loop. The same arithmetic is done
    here on the whole matrix, and gives the same numbers.

    The residual of a gene is the standard normal deviate at the point
    where the observed count falls in the distribution the model
    predicted for it:

    .. math::

       r_{ij} = \\Phi^{-1}\\left( F(k_{ij}; \\mu_{ij}, r_{ij}) \\right)

    Parameters
    ----------
    df_obs_counts : :class:`pandas.DataFrame`
        The observed counts. Samples are rows and genes are columns.

    df_pred_means : :class:`pandas.DataFrame`
        The predicted scaled means, as the model writes them. They are
        rescaled here by the mean count of each sample, which is what
        turns them into counts.

    df_r_values : :class:`pandas.DataFrame`, optional
        The predicted r-values, if the genes' counts were modelled with
        negative binomial distributions. If they are not given, the
        counts are taken to have been modelled with Poisson
        distributions.

    scaling_factor : :class:`str`, ``"mean"``
        Whether the predicted means are scaled by the ``"mean"`` or
        the ``"median"`` count of a sample.

        This has to match what the MODEL was trained with. The default
        is ``"mean"`` for backward compatibility only - it is the
        wrong value for any model whose configuration says
        ``scaling_factor: "median"``, and getting it wrong shifts every
        residual in one direction rather than adding noise. On the base
        model, which is a median model, using the mean puts the mean
        residual at about -1.7 instead of 0.

    config_model : :class:`dict`, optional
        The model's configuration. When given, its ``scaling_factor``
        is used and the argument above is ignored - which is the only
        way to be certain the residuals and the model agree.

    clip : :class:`float`, ``0.0``
        How far from nought and one to hold the cumulative distribution
        before the inverse normal is taken of it.

        Nought, by default, so that this function gives back exactly
        what :func:`get_residuals` gives back - the two agree to
        5e-11, which is the arithmetic and nothing else.

        The inverse normal is infinite at nought and at one, though, and
        a count far enough out in the tail of its own distribution will
        put it there: a few dozen genes in every few thousand samples.
        :func:`get_residuals` returns those infinities, and anything
        that goes on to take a principal component of the residuals will
        fail on them.

        Passing ``1e-12`` holds the cumulative distribution just inside
        its bounds, so that a gene the model finds impossible gets a
        large residual (about 7) rather than an infinite one. It changes
        nothing else: about one residual in two thousand, all of them in
        the extreme tail.

        A data frame displaying the distribution of genes having a
        residual value greater than or equal to ``le_than``  across
        different sample counts.

        Each row represents the number of samples, and the columns are:

          exactly that many samples.
        - 'genes': a period-separated string listing the genes that
          meet the condition in exactly that many samples..
